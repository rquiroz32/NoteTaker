## Description
This is a project given to me for my coding bootcamp. We were provided with front end code but had to use node.js and express to store User note data as JSON. The app will add newly added notes to the json file and delete notes on the click of the delete button from the JSON file. There is only one JSON file used by everyone for this excercise.
